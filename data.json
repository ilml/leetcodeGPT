If it is, we return the indices of the current element and the value stored in the hashmap. If it is not, we store the difference between the target and the current element in the hashmap.\n\nHere is the implementation of the solution in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n        hashmap = {}\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            complement = target - num\n            if complement in hashmap:\n                return [hashmap[complement], i]\n            hashmap[num] = i\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) since we iterate through the array exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, as we store at most n elements in the hashmap."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 279, "completion_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 482}}
