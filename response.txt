        "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to store the indices of the numbers we have encountered so far. \n\nWe iterate through the array and for each number, we calculate the complement by subtracting the target from the current number. If the complement exists in the hashmap, we have found the pair of numbers that adds up to the target and we return the indices of the current number and complement.\n\nIf the complement does not exist in the hashmap, we add the current number and its index to the hashmap and continue iterating.\n\nHere is the updated solution:\n\n```\nclass Solution:\n    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n        # Create a hashmap to store indices\n        hashmap = {}\n        \n        # Iterate through the array\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            # Calculate the complement\n            complement = target - num\n            \n            # Check if the complement exists in the hashmap\n            if complement in hashmap:\n                # Return the indices of the current num and complement\n                return [hashmap[complement], i]\n            \n            # Add the current num and its index to the hashmap\n            hashmap[num] = i\n        \n        # Return an empty list if no solution is found\n        return []\n```\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums. This is because we need to iterate through the entire array once to find the two numbers that add up to the target."
